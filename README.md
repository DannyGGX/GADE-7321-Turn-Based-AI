#Gravity Shift Connect 4
##Code Architecture Planning
I've made my own version of UML to help with planning and seeing the overview of the whole project.\
It looks a bit messy (and overwelming at first, and boy it was overwhelming to start coding after the mental exhastion from planning the implementation)\
but I find it helps a lot more to plan projects than not doing any diagramming.\
