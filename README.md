# Gravity Shift Connect 4
Play locally against a friend or (soon) against AI of different difficulty levels in this spinoff Connect 4 game.\
In this game you have to predict where pieces will land when the gravity shifts. The gravity shifts in an anti-clockwise fashion, starting in the down direction, then right, up, left, down, and so on.\
The gravity shifts every 3 turns.

## Made for
Programming module in the 5th semester of the game design course at Vega. We have to create a turn based game that uses the Minimax or Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm - we chose Minimax.

## Code Architecture Planning
I've made my own version of UML to help with planning and seeing the overview of the whole project.\
It looks a bit messy (and overwelming at first, and boy it was overwhelming to start coding after the mental exhastion from planning the implementation)\
but I find it helps a lot more to plan projects than not doing any diagramming.\
